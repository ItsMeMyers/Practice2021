         * 
         * The pose supplier: This is a method reference (or lambda) to the drive
         * subsystem method that returns the pose. The RAMSETE controller needs the
         * current pose measurement to determine the required wheel outputs.
         * 
         * The RAMSETE controller: This is the RamseteController object (Java, C++) that
         * will perform the path-following computation that translates the current
         * measured pose and trajectory state into a chassis speed setpoint.
         * 
         * The drive feedforward: This is a SimpleMotorFeedforward object (Java, C++)
         * that will automatically perform the correct feedforward calculation with the
         * feedforward gains (kS, kV, and kA) that we obtained from the drive
         * characterization tool.
         * 
         * The drive kinematics: This is the DifferentialDriveKinematics object (Java,
         * C++) that we constructed earlier in our constants file, and will be used to
         * convert chassis speeds to wheel speeds.
         * 
         * The wheel speed supplier: This is a method reference (or lambda) to the drive
         * subsystem method that returns the wheel speeds
         * 
         * The left-side PIDController: This is the PIDController object (Java, C++)
         * that will track the left-side wheel speed setpoint, using the P gain that we
         * obtained from the drive characterization tool.
         * 
         * The right-side PIDController: This is the PIDController object (Java, C++)
         * that will track the right-side wheel speed setpoint, using the P gain that we
         * obtained from the drive characterization tool.
         * 
         * The output consumer: This is a method reference (or lambda) to the drive
         * subsystem method that passes the voltage outputs to the drive motors.
         * 
         * The robot drive: This is the drive subsystem itself, included to ensure the
